Wait! What is bytecode?
-----------------------

Bytecode is opcodes for the `Python Virtual Machine`_. -- Confused?

If you want to deep-dive into the topic watch the 2013 EuroPython talk
`"All Singing All Dancing Python Bytecode"`_ by Larry Hastings.
Otherwise James Bennett's `"Introduction to Python bytecode"`_ should
provide you with just the sound understanding of what it is all about.

Why not simply use ``rm **/*.pyc`` or ``find -name '*.py?' -delete``?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're happy with ``rm`` or ``find``, go for it! When I was `looking
for a simple, concise solution for everybody`_ I figured people are
struggling, and simple things are more complicated than they appear at
first sight.

Also, there is a ``pyclean`` command (and its siblings) on Debian. And,
well, only on Debian as it turns out. Not that I'm a big fan of Mircosoft
Windos, but why ignore the biggest Python population on this planet?
(As if they weren't punished enough already using this unfree piece of
software!)

Debian
------

Just for reference, the Python scripts Debian ships with its
`python-minimal`_ and `python3-minimal`_ packages can be found at:

- pyclean: `salsa.debian.org/cpython-team/python-defaults
  <https://salsa.debian.org/cpython-team/python-defaults/blob/master/pyclean>`__
- py3clean: `salsa.debian.org/cpython-team/python3-defaults
  <https://salsa.debian.org/cpython-team/python3-defaults/blob/master/py3clean>`__
- pypyclean: `salsa.debian.org/debian/pypy
  <https://salsa.debian.org/debian/pypy/blob/debian/debian/scripts/pypyclean>`__

.. _python-minimal: https://packages.debian.org/stable/python-minimal
.. _python3-minimal: https://packages.debian.org/stable/python3-minimal

Installation
============

.. code:: console

    $ pip install pyclean

Usage
=====

.. code:: console

    $ pyclean --help

If you want to explicitly operate the version-specific implementation:

.. code:: console

    $ py2clean --help
    $ py3clean --help
    $ pypyclean --help

Clean up all bytecode in the current directory tree, and explain verbosely:

.. code:: console

    $ pyclean -v .

Clean up all bytecode for a Debian package: (may require root permissions)

.. code:: console

    $ pyclean -p python3-keyring

Use pyclean with Tox
--------------------

If you want to avoid installing ``pyclean`` you can add it to your
``tox.ini`` file as follows:

.. code:: ini

    [testenv:clean]
    deps = pyclean
    commands = pyclean {toxinidir}

You'll then be able to run it with `Tox`_ like this:

.. code:: console

    $ tox -e clean

.. _Tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/

Roadmap (for v2.0.0)
====================

#. Consolidate original Debian scripts into a single code base that
   serves all target platforms (py27, py3x, pypy2.7, pypy3.5).
#. Ensure the package is actually tested also on Windows NT and Darwin
   target machines :-) (AppVeyor and Travis CI).
#. Reduce the package dependencies to an absolute minimum for maximum
   portability.
#. Add additional CLI options to delete debris from builds, testing and
   packaging (build/, .cache/, dist/, .pytest_cache/, .tox/ and
   free-form targets).
